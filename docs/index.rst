What is ITK-SNAP DSS?
---------------------
DSS stands for *Distributed Segmentation Services*. It is an architecture that allows medical image segmentation tasks to be implemented as services on the Internet. These services can be easily accessed via interactive software like ITK-SNAP and using a thin command-line client. This documentation is focused on algorithm developers interested in making their tools available through the service.
